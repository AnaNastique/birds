      My search for the bird continued without a single clue or a result for several months. Those several months were much more than the academia mobility grant could offer to me. The project was approved because the rare bird that I am looking for supposedly was a symbol of native people from my island in 1600 and then by mistake taken by conquistadors to the mainland. This bird could showcase how mainlanders take care of the heritage of the natives even first they took the freedom that the bird was symbolising and cut the natives' crops so the only place where the bird survived was the mainland. 
      
      Ironic, isn’t it? I’m here, searching for a bird that once symbolized freedom, but now I feel more trapped than ever. Stuck in this town, with no results, and even less of an idea of where to go next. I can’t help but wonder—am I just as lost as this bird?I bought a pack of cigarettes. I knew this moment was coming. The moment when I would have to say yes to any work proposed to me in the town. Why wouldn’t I go back to academia? Sometimes it feels easier to wash dishes in a smoky bar than to abandon work that feels unfinished, even if just for a few months. The deal wasn’t about prestige or the fear that the funds were spent and unjustified. It wasn’t even about the understanding glances from colleagues or the cold, polite emails from the foundation. What terrified me was the new, tiny wrinkle between my eyebrows—a hieroglyph marking the unstable balance between left and right, time etched into my skin. It meant time was still passing, and I couldn’t afford to float in life’s stream anymore.
       
      However, another task was supposed to be done before I made my tenth stroll around the archives. Lighting up a cigarette pushed me to think about Lele. I was never a heavy smoker, but cigarettes would always save me in heavy moments. I liked neither their smell nor their taste. I always bought the heaviest options, the ones that left a distinctive trace of smoke on my clothes and yellow nicotine stains on my fingers after only a few weeks of smoking.
        
      I know that I shouldn’t be in my room right now, the pile of adapted traces of my life are sorted in folders. The first one shows me as a researcher. The chance that this persona could make a living in this town was miserable. So, there was another folder for Mr. Hyde—raised by the fear of being kicked out of a dim room and living on the streets. This folder held CVs for bartenders, waiters, and cleaners—someone who could kill a rat in a kitchen and continue chopping zucchini without missing a beat. The third persona, however, was sitting right there, consuming cigarette smoke.
        
      “What’s Lele doing right now?” I hated thinking about it and couldn’t help it. Why hasn’t anyone invented a way to protect the inner space from others yet?
        
      The smoke drifted upward. Lele, always lingering, taking up space in my thoughts but never leaving behind anything substantial. Was it the idea that is stuck, that it always occupies a room in my mind in the moments of procrastination? Like smoke, there wasn’t much to hold on to, just a presence that refused to fully dissipate.
        
      Lele never filled a space with meaning, talking in circles, and making grand plans that never amounted to anything. And yet, it occupied so much mental real estate. The memory was like the bird I was searching for—elusive, always just out of reach, but taking up more of me than I wanted to admit.
        
      I had never told no. Always yes, yes, yes, nodding along as if agreeing would make us feel more real, as if the consent could somehow make the presence more meaningful. But freedom isn’t in the yes. Freedom is in the no—the rejection of everything laid out before you. If you can’t say "No," not even once, are you truly free? Saying “Yes” is like choosing a path from a map someone else has drawn. The options are laid out for you, limited and pre-determined. In agreeing, you’re stepping into a space that’s already been defined.
        
      But “No” is different. It rejects the map entirely. When you say "No," you step into the unknown, where no path is set, and all directions are open. It’s not just a refusal—it’s the freedom to chart your course, to imagine what could be rather than accepting what’s offered. 
        
      That’s what I thought about when I met that guy once—the one who deleted people’s data after they died. His job was to say no, even after people were gone. To wipe everything clean, as if they’d never existed. I couldn’t decide if that was freedom, or just another attempt to control something uncontrollable. Like, a real-life eraser. Imagine that. You kick the bucket, and he comes in, cleans up your digital trail, wipes out your emails, social media, your cloud storage, everything—gone. It’s like you never existed in the digital world at all. He called it a “post-mortem cleanse,” but I couldn’t help thinking, is that really what people want? To vanish, to leave nothing behind? 
        
      It seems just another attempt for a big "No"—a final refusal, not just to life, but to the world’s ability to define who you were. He said people pay big money for this, to make sure their last fingerprint on the world disappears the moment they’re gone. I nodded, trying to wrap my head around it—this need to control everything, even after death. 
        
      Saying “No” in life, or erasing yourself after death—it’s all about control. Whether you reject the choices laid before you or wipe your existence clean, it’s a way of asserting freedom over what’s left behind. But is that really freedom?
        
      It's like these birds Bem-te-vi. Tiny things but they act like they’re predators. They mimic the call of hawks, those high, sharp cries that send other birds scattering. You look at them, and you’d never guess they could pull it off. They sit there on the branch, yellow-bellied and small, calling out like they’re something bigger, scarier. They fake it, they survive by pretending to be something they’re not, by projecting power they don’t have. 
        
      That’s us too. We strut around, acting like we’ve got control over our lives, over what happens after we’re gone, like we’re the hawks in the sky. We mimic power with all this data protection—locking down our memories, managing our legacies, trying to stave off the inevitable. But really, we’re just little Bem-te-vi birds—pretending we have control, when in the end, we don’t. It’s all an illusion.
        
      I wonder if that’s what I’ve been missing. Maybe the real freedom is in letting go of the need to control what comes next. The bird, the project, even Lele—maybe none of it matters as much as I’ve convinced myself. Maybe it’s the act of searching that matters, not what I leave behind.
        
      Obsession with data protection is the opposite of art. Artists pour themselves into something, but once it’s out in the world, they lose control. They can’t dictate what’ll happen to their work after they’re gone. Some stranger might hang a painting in a bathroom or a novel might end up in a dusty secondhand bookstore, forgotten and waiting for some lost soul to pick it up. There’s no command over the legacy—art slips from the fingers the moment it leaves them. It’s the ultimate act of surrender.
        
      But the obsession with data protection is also like art. It’s humans trying to exert control over what happens to their lives, their digital selves after they’ve taken their last breath. They can’t bear the thought of privacy, unseen footage floating around once they’re not here to manage it. It’s the same impulse, in a way. Just as artists want their work to speak for them, people want their carefully curated data to reflect their image after they’re gone. They’re all trying to shape the after-life footprint—whether it’s the masterpiece they leave behind or the browser history they don’t. 
        
      Lele never changed, living frozen in my mind. That was the most frustrating thing. All those talks about freedom, about doing something bigger, about how we were all just occupying space. And here I was—stuck in this town, chasing a bird that might not even exist, trapped in a loop of inaction and hesitation. Maybe I was just the same —pretending that the search for this bird, for meaning, was enough to keep me going. Maybe I was afraid to admit that I hadn’t moved either.
        
      Lele had stayed in my mind because I had left room for it. I hadn’t said "No". I hadn’t said "No" to the job offers in the bar either, even though I kept convincing myself I still had time to be something else. I kept nodding along, like I did with Lele, as if saying yes would create meaning out of nothing. Freedom is in the "No." But somehow, I had forgotten how to say it.
        
      It wasn’t that Lele had been important—at least, not in the way people usually are. There was no real challenge, no pushing to be better, not even real love, I think. But the connection between us was there, filling in the gaps, and giving me something else to think about when my own life felt too heavy to bear.
        
      It was a distraction, like the cigarettes I kept buying even though I hated the taste. I lit them one after another, and for a few minutes, the frustration of failure, of another day gone without a lead, would fade. Lele had been like that too. A way to pass the time, to keep the emptiness at bay. 
        
      Humans are scared of death, it’s not a secret. Planning and controlling are the less destructive ways of coping with fears. Keep the reels running just right after they're gone. Death is the enemy, right? Planning, managing, locking things up tight, and trying to fight off death one password at a time. "I’ll be gone but at least my family won’t lose the bank account." You smile to yourself, thinking you’ve done it, cheated the reaper. But guess what? You can lock up your data all you want, but you can't stop your kid from blowing that hard-earned cash on a ballerina from Moscow. Yeah, he met her in a bar last month, bought her drinks and dreams, and now your careful savings are going down in a whirl. 
        
      Like Bem-te-vis humans call themselves predators, hoping no one notices how small they are. It is mimicking control, projecting something they don’t have. Trying to convince the world they’re free when the reality is that they’re just playing a part in a much bigger game.
        
      Humans are control freaks, they can’t help it. Saying No, saying Yes—it’s all wrapped up in this weird game of consent. It feels good, comforting even. You give consent, you think you’re in charge. Do humans ever really give consent to others to dig into their private data? Or do they just hand it over blindly, too scared to say no because connection—real human connection—is terrifying? They risk becoming the walking dead in someone else’s life. A ghost in the data.
        
      I looked out over the empty sky, wondering if the bird was even real. Maybe humans never really know if any of this is real. Are they alive, or are they just part of some giant puppet show, dangling by strings they can't see? Descartes had it down. He sat in that dark room of his, doubting everything, stripping it down to the bones. Cogito, ergo sum. I think, therefore I am. But even Descartes had to wonder, is this all a dream? Could God, some big divine man, just be screwing with him? Descartes believed in this blank slate idea, this tabula rasa, that humans come into this world empty, untouched, ready to be filled with knowledge, experience, and life. But is that really true? Or the tabula rasa is just canvases for someone else’s graffiti? Are children born blank, waiting to be written on by life itself, or are they already marked before the first breath by others’ expectations, society’s paint-splattered hands? What if someone else is holding the pen, writing your story, and you’re just filling in the gaps with dreams and ghosts of your own making?
        
      Well, humans need validation to prove they’re here, to prove they’re alive. They need someone else to look at them, and say, "You exist”. Descartes was trying to validate himself, staring into the void and hoping the void stared back. But that’s the thing—when the void doesn't answer, how do you know you’re even real anymore? If you can’t hear someone else say “I see you,” you might as well be vapour.
        
      But what if the other person doesn’t validate you? What if they ghost you? Ghosting isn’t just disappearing from someone’s life. It’s not becoming a ghost—it’s turning someone else into a ghost. You erase them. You cut their connection to reality. It’s brutal. And yet, even dead, even as ghosts, they still leave behind some stuff. Ghosts still have assets. You’ll find them scattered in the flea markets of the world, abandoned and forgotten.
        
      I heard this tale once—some artist from Georgia, was sending flowers to an actress every single day, even after he was long dead. Even after he was dusted, his bank account was still playing the game, validating his existence, a petal at a time. The power of assets. Before, it was letters, love letters. The aristocrats used ink, waiting for validation in return. But now? Now it’s dating app chats, quick messages, and quick validation from someone who’ll find you valuable—if only for the night. What assets do humans leave in the dark corners of flea markets? 
      - a set of memes (the ghost was the only person able to understand King of the Hill) 
      
- an instructions on how to fill in VAT declaration (the ghost was so beautifully good in these things, sadly we will not share the pension plan)
        - a mother’s contacts 
        - promises 
        - hospital bills (abortions and beaten fingers, nothing serious) 
        
      Data that we don’t give the consent for: 
        - Access to dreams
        - Favourite songs 
        - The only good cookie flavour 
        - Friends’ numbers 
        
      Isn’t it so hurtful to be a ghost? To drift through the world, bound by memories and digital fragments, with no control over the data we once shared and received? But once someone is gone, there’s no secret service to sweep away the leftovers of the existence. No one to delete that joke they told at the wrong moment or erase the book recommendations that now seem like obscure footnotes in someone else’s memory.
        
      I thought again about the bird—the one I was searching for. A symbol of freedom, taken by conquistadors and trapped on the mainland, just like me. Stolen space, stolen time. Maybe the bird was never real, just like Lele’s promises of a better future. Maybe it was all an illusion, something to fill the space and distract from the fact that nothing was actually happening.
        
      Lele used to talk about control. “We can’t control anything really, we’re all just filling in the blanks, occupying space without content, hoping it’ll matter to someone else.” I used to agree. But now I wondered—was that control, or just another way of giving up?
        
      Maybe the only way to manage the following shadow of death, to make peace with its inevitability, is to accept that the city is full of souls, already dead in someone’s eyes, every one of them. We embrace the idea that death isn’t just the end but a transition into a state where our presence exists in the memories and data we leave behind, even if we can’t control how it’s remembered.
