      <h2>The BIRDMAN</h2>
      <p>In my country, they say you either eat or get eaten. Back then, hunger chewed me from time to time, but I wasn’t built for gobbling anything, not people, not prey, not even opportunities. I guess I was a gentle and sweet soul. But I wasn’t about to let the world swallow me whole either. The way I saw it, life was a short flicker. 
        There was a time I had this dream—a sweaty, confused one, somewhere on a beat-up couch in a house that smelled like weed,  cat piss (the cat was called Ganesha), and the lingering despair of teenagers whose mother had long given up on seeing them in white collars. In that dream, a massive cement mixer churned me and all my friends into the tarmac, grinding us down until we were part of the pavement itself. 
        I didn’t mind to fuck it all and I remember thinking, that’s not too far off. It was life, and we all kept enjoying the same tune, not because we were free, but because the tune was all we knew. In the end isn’t life too similar to a quick roll between buying amphetamine and shaking convulsions of a body too used to something stronger, nastier? Similarities are too obvious to avoid them: 
        People act like they have free will, but it’s just that the opportunity presents itself.
        You could say no, you could stop, but you keep going—because everyone else does.
        No one guarantees you anything, and yet, you keep playing along. 
        The end is meaningless, it’s the process that matters. 
        Somewhere in the middle, there’s a fleeting chance for happiness, and you enjoy it while it lasts. 
        But alongside that shameful habit of imagining myself dead while high, the university handed me another strange hobby—staring into the sky, imagining myself not just dead, but not alive, transformed. I wasn’t thinking of death as an ending. To me, death was just unplugging, cutting off the cords of the computer. But sometimes I’d wonder, what if it’s more like a giant drive? What if all the data just gets stored somewhere else? Then, maybe you could access it from another device, something more refined than mine. By sheer chance, using this new device, you might even stumble upon shared access to some private storage. Who knows? What if, by connecting through a VPN, you suddenly unlock information that was never available to you before?
        Life started to feel a little overpriced to me like we were all paying too much for something we didn’t fully understand. Why do people cling to it so desperately, investing every ounce of energy just to keep it going? Sure, the fear of the unknown—the fact that what comes after is a blank map—can be terrifying. But isn’t it just as likely that what’s waiting for us is peace, not torment? Scientists argue that there is more evidence pointing toward some kind of nirvana than hell afterwards.
        If that's the case, why are we so afraid to let go? We spend our whole lives preserving something as fragile as breath, yet we refuse to consider the possibility that what comes next might be better, or at least, not worse. I thought about explorers sometimes. In April 1500, a Portuguese guy landed in Brazil, looking for something else. In July of ‘69, we put a guy on the moon, still chasing something else. We’ve conquered the sea and the sky. Why’s death still this big mystery, this terra incognita? No need to kill natives for that land, no war was required. It’s just there, waiting.
        The whole thing felt like a cosmic hustle—a game where the stakes are rigged, but no one’s sure what the prize is. So why keep playing? Maybe the real fear isn’t death, but the idea that all our struggling might have been for nothing.
        But I wasn’t cut out to be a theologian, and I liked amphetamines too much to study philosophy. Nothing against the great minds of psychology, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that studying your own species requires a certain kind of ego. You either need the towering ego of someone like Freud, who saw the human psyche as a grand puzzle to be solved, or you’ve got to completely strip away that ego, like many doctors do, approaching their patients with a humility that sometimes feels almost saintly.
        But I wondered: how can you truly understand the complexities of human behaviour when you’re part of the equation? It’s like trying to dissect your own reflection. You get lost in the intricacies, tangled in the very emotions and biases that colour your perception. 
        That’s how I became an ornithologist.
        I had a kaleidoscope of thoughts in the short moment between the milk leaving the cartoon pack and touching the crunchy surface of the cereals. I thought if life even has a price what does it mean to have a price against priceless? 
        If life is such an absurd, I want to play by its absurd rules. However, knowing the rules means being clear in your intentions. 
        I pushed up the left corner of my lips as I knew even a fake smile could start a right chain reaction in my mind. My eyes are more deep when I am bothered. 
        In one hour after I brushed my teeth, I decided to follow the advice of a Nepalese monk who currently had no address except for his tent: put your feet in the water and meditate. 
        After I separated rice and lentils, I realised that only two things are important when using this method: following the strategy of your choice and living through whatever emotions. Usually, people who study birds don’t get the Nobel. No one leaves angry or delighted comments if some bird was saved from extinction. However, this study meant for me not only to hide and sick with a species that no one even knows exists. I felt like leaving my city for a while. I had a perfect metronome of what you could call a tendency to a catastrophe in my guts. In days like that, it was so easy to forget an umbrella in a bus, or gloves in a dream. 
        Those gloves always represent the hands of my mother. She has the softest skin and moisturizes them with a cream every evening. They smell good and they are carrying. She broke them twice. The gloves represented the shadow as well. “The shadow card is the card that's on the bottom of the deck after you've finished pulling/picking your cards out for the question or spread. It may represent the underlying energy of a situation, something that is factoring everything, something extra to consider, encouragement. It depends on the context, it's kinda like a card that clarifies everything in the reading” @toolucidgirl, Reddit. 
        Every time I would go through a dark and fresh forest, that wet when your fingers are a little paralyzed. But my fingers are nice and warm. Every time, I decided to pick up snowdrops and take away the gloves. I put them on a branch and start walking with full hands of the flowers. Then I realize that I forgot the gloves but the forest already looks differently. It’s dark and absorbing. The darkness feels like a soundproof curtain in clubs and theatres. Could it mean that I left my fears somewhere or that I am naked from now on? 
        I felt happy that I was chosen for the study. Except for finding the bird, they asked me to write a diary. They wanted to know how I would react in case of endless uncertainty. As well, they wanted to know if I even prove to myself that I found the right bird. They said, that if someone can truly believe in such abstraction, then love should exist. We call love a constant search for someone, and we have only an image developed by ourselves with a shortcut sorted into green and red flags. It may sound like a joke, but MRT proved that the same zone highlights in both cases.</p>
